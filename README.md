Simple **Travel company** application made using **PHP** and **HTML** that uses **MySQL** as the database.

 ### Motivation


The motivation for developing this travel app came about because I love to travel. In addition, using the available sites to buy tours, there is also the possibility to develop your own customized
shopping app from scratch, because specially designed platforms are expensive. Also, I appreciate
the recent learning of the Java and JavaScript programming languages, and how
powerful and dynamic they are when it comes to web design and applications. . The languages used to
build this app are JavaScript, HTML, and Java, because I found them extremely useful.
useful while working on technology in my workplace

### User Interface
In the Travel Company app, you can find two types of interface::
1. **User interface:** The user can view the home page of the application's shopping cart,
view different categories, view any tours, view information about each location, and buy bids .
2. **Admin Interface:** The administrator can view the user information that was entered
during checkout in the database, can update the information, price, ticket price, add or remove tours from the main display.

### Travel Package Function
1. Display all the categories available for travel package on the systemâ€™s main page.
2. Display all the items linked to each category listed on the main page.
3. Allow the administrator to add new items to the existing list of available items.
